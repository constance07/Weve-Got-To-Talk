# BE HONEST,
## How much do you really know about yourself?
In considering the question, you probably thought to respond with your name, some details about your personality, or maybe a few miscellaneous hobbies, but that's not what I'm asking for. Today, the way we define ourselves is primarily based on these labels: how we can fit into a larger social category (i.e. “I'm good at basketball'", “I'm very funny", “I like to play video games”, etc.). But, what if all that were to be taken away from you? Is there anything left? WE'VE GOT TO TALK about how to find yourself separate from titles by focusing on the opinions, ideas, and beliefs that create them. So, if you're really curious about how to answer this question, start playing to find out. But, remember this experience as a new perspective to approach life with, not just a card game.

## Credits
Huge thank you to my mom, sister, abuela, cousin, Ant, and funcle(fake uncle). Also, to my friends, Ayira and Jaida. You guys have all offered me great support and wisdom along the way, inspiring me to want more both of the world, and myself.
